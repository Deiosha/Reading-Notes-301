### How I explained REST to my brother

1. Roy Fielding is a smart guy. He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet.
2. Why the techniques we use today don't work well is because computers that talk to each other didn't have certain requirements. 
3. Is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
4. GET is responsible for helping you get stuff.
5. POST is responsible for when one system needs to add something to another system.
6. PUT is for when a system wants to replace something in another system.
7. PATCH is used to do a partial update.
