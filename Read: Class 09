### Functional Programming Concepts

1. Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
2. Pure function are essential for a variety of purposes, including functional programming, reliable concurrency, and React+Redux app. When know something us pure function when It returns the same result if given the same arguments.
3. The benefits of pure function is that it does not cause any observable side effects.
4. Immutability is when you can’t change something after it has been created.
5. Referential transparency is when  a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
