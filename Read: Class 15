### What is OAuth

1. OAuth allows websites and services to share assets among users. It is widely accepted, but be aware of its vulnerabilities.
2. An example is telling Github that it is fine if Netlify wants to access a repo.
3. OAuth is basically an authenticator provider for the user. First youâ€™ll need  OAuth 2.0 credentials, an access token, access for the user, send the token, and restart.
4. OpenId is a single sign-in, vouching for the identities of users.

### Authorization and Authentication flows

1. Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is and authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.
2. Authorization Code Flow is to ensure the source code is not publicly exposed,3
3. During authentication, mobile and native applications can use the Authorization Code Flow, but they require additional security. Additionally, single-page apps have special challenges. To mitigate these, OAuth 2.0 provides a version of the Authorization Code Flow which makes use of a Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).
4. intended for Public Clients, or applications which are unable to securely store Client Secrets.
5. With machine-to-machine (M2M) applications, such as CLIs, daemons, or services running on your back-end, the system authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user.
6. Rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device.
7. requests that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form.
