### React lifecycle: 

1. Based on the diagram, the ‘render’ happens first. 
2. The very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React is Mounting. In this process, a component is created in the DOM. During this phase, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount occur. 
3. Constructor, componentWillUnmount, render, componentDidMount, React Updates
4. componentDidMount is supposed to execute the react code. 

### React state vs. props:

1. Things you can pass in the props are functions.
2. The big difference between props passes in a component and are handled outside the component, and state is handled inside the component. 
3. We re-render our application after the changes have been made. 
4. Some examples of things we could store in the state are when the user has updated a value or when we want to change something in our applications so it can adequately re-render. 

### Things I want to know more about:
1. I would like to see more examples of props and states.
