### NoSQL vs SQL

[NoSQL VS SQL](read%208.pnj.png)

1. SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.
2. A real world example is MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.
3. NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data).
4. Hbase is an example for this purpose.
5. key-value pair way of storing is best for hierarchical data storage.
6. NoSQL is best for scalability.

### SQL vs NoSQL

1. SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
2. A relational database is a database that supports structured query language.
3. The type of structure a relational database work with table.
4. A ‘schema’ is for the data that is stored.
5. NoSQL database are databases that store data in a format besides relational tables.
6. It works by when in the database we see collections which carries Documents and they don’t have to use the same schema.
7. It stores things such as documents.
8. MongoDB is more flexible because you need to use the exact schema for your documents.
9. The disadvantage of a NoSQL database is duplicated data.
