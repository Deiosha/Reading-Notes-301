### Thinking In React

1. The single responsibility principle is a component that does one thing. This applies to components because If the component grows it will be created into small components.
2. To build a ‘static’ version of my application means to render my data models that reuses other components and passes data using props.
3. Once you have a static application, you’ll add states.
4. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
5. Identify every component that renders something based on that state. Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy). Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

### Higher-Order Function

1. higher-order Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.
2. It is going through an argument and determine if it is true or false.
3. The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values. The new array will have the same length as the input array, but its content will have been mapped to a new form by the function.
