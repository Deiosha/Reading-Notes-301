### API Design Best Practice

1. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
2. REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.
3. An identifier of resources for example can look like https://adventure-works.com/orders/1.
4. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
5. URIâ€™s should be based on its own unique URI.
6. https://adventure-works.com/orders
7. A chatty web API is a bad thing and it is when web APIs expose a large number of small resources.
8. A successful GET request returns HTTP status code 200 (OK).
9. An unsuccessful GET request returns return 404 (Not Found).
10. A successful POST request returns HTTP status code 201 (Created).
11. A successful  DELETE request returns HTTP status code 204 (No Content).
